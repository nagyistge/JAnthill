JAnthill has been built with the purpose of being modular, simple and efficient, in this order of importance.
JAnthill is being developed by Rodrigo Caetano O. ROCHA (http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rcor/).

JAnthill is a Java implementation of the Anthill filter-stream programming model.
Anthill is a programming model for processing large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster (an alternative for the largely known MapReduce programming model).

Anthill was originaly created on 2005 and it is still a subject of research.
The original paper can be read at http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~dorgival/artigos/sbac2005.pdf.

The JAnthill API is not very stable yet, since it still under construction (we are still considering it as a beta version).
But you can download it and use it freely, knowning that if you want to update your JAnthill version, you might have to change your applications a bit.
